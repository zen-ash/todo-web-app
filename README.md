## Overview

This repository contains a lightweight to‑do list web application built using **plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript**.  It was created as a practice project to demonstrate how to build a usable app without reaching for a framework.  Despite its simplicity, the app includes all the features you’d expect from a to‑do list and looks great on desktop and mobile.

## Features

- **Add tasks** – Type a description and click “Add” to append it to the list.
- **Edit tasks** – Click an existing task to edit its text inline.
- **Delete tasks** – Remove completed tasks with a single click.
- **Persist data** – Uses `localStorage` so your tasks remain when you refresh the page.
- **Responsive design** – Adjusts layout for small screens and large displays using flexbox.

## Demo

You can see a live version of this app by opening `index.html` in your browser or visiting the GitHub Pages deployment (if available).

```bash

# Open the app
open index.html  # or double‑click the file in your file explorer

No build step or package installation is required – everything is handled client‑side.
